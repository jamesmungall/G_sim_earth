# Asteroids and Near Earth Objects Gravity Simulation Orrery
## Made for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024
---

This is the repository for a team in participating for the NASA Space Apps Challenge from the Met Office in Exeter, England in 2024, based off of the Orrery Challenge provided.

We researched the different gravitational interactions on celestial objects and learned the mathematical concepts. We then implemented these in python and used matplotlib to plot out the tragectory of an asteroid around a single celestial body. We then modified the code to work with two different celestial bodies. Finally, we implemented all of this into C# in the Unity game engine to make it all more visually appearing and interactive.

The original Python code for one Celestial object: `PythonBaseScripts/OrreryOneBody.py`
The original Python code for two Celestial objects: `PythonBaseScripts/OrreryTwoBodys.py`
There are also example images of each one in the same `PythonBaseScripts` folder.

Then the Unity project is just in the root directory.

The `index.html` file contains a bit more information for of the project. There is also a presentation which was used to present the project at the nd of the weekend at the Met Office.

Here is a [link](https://i.simmer.io/@v0games/gsim) to a demo of the finnished project.

This was made by Javi, Tilly, Ben, James and Benjy.
