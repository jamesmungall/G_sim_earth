  <h4>
    Introduction:
  </h4>
  <p>

    We calculated the trajectory of the asteroid Eros as it goes around the sun and past the earth. Will the gravity of the earth cause the asteriod to crash into the earth?
  </p>
    <br/>
  <h4>
    Method:
  </h4>
  <p>
    For a short period of time (initially 0.2s), we calculated the change in velocity of the asteroid due to the effect of gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The change in velocity is proportional to the mass of the sun (or earth), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
  </p>
  <p>In other words, the asteroid is more strongly affected by a bigger mass, and very strongly affected by the distance of the asteroid from the sun (or earth).
  </p>
  <p>
    From the new velocity we calculate the new position of the asteroid.

    Then the process is repeated for the next increment of time.
  </p>
    <br/>
  <h4>
    Implementation in python:
  </h4>
  <p>
    This calculation was completed in python with the following script:

  </p>
  <p>
    The results were plotted using matplotlib on python.
  </p>
    <p>
      The blue line shows the trajectory of the asteroid. It begins in the bottom left of the picture and moves
       towards the green dot above, which represents the earth. The it swirls around the earth a few times 
      before being pulled off towards the right. This is due to the attraction of the sun, represented by
       a green dot in the bottom left hand corner of the image.
    <p>
As can be seen the asteroid follows a bizarre trajectory! However, we were please to see that the asteroid seems to be attracted to both the earth and the sun as it should be.
The errors may come about due to mistakes in our programming, or the inherent loss of precision by incrementing the calculation in short periods of time.

  <h4>
    Implementation in C# and Unity:
  </h4>
    <br/>
  <p>
    The calculation was also completed in C# with the following script:

    <p>
The Unity implementation looks much better, perhaps because the increment of time was shorter. We also like the 3D
      rendering which is possible in Unity.
