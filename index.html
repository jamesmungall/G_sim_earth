  <h4>
    Introduction:
  </h4>
  <p>

    We calculated the trajectory of the asteroid Eros as it goes around the sun and past the earth. Will the gravity of the earth cause the asteriod to crash into the earth?
  </p>
  <h4>
    Method:Introduction:
  </h4>
  <p>
    For a short period of time (initially 0.2s), we calculated the change in velocity of the asteroid due to the effect of gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The change in velocity is proportional to the mass of the sun (or earth), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
  </p>
  <p>In other words, the asteroid is more strongly affected by a bigger mass, and very strongly affected by the distance of the asteroid from the sun (or earth).
  </p>
  <p>
    From the new velocity we calculate the new position of the asteroid.

    Then the process is repeated for the next increment of time.

    The results were plotted using matplotlib on python.
